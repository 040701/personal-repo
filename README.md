This is the research about Simulation of ferroelectric materials research based on the first principle
Under the guidance of Professor Liang Zhao and senior students.

Since This project mainly focuses on crafting and technology application, which is good for undergraduate students to start to know primarily how to carry out scientific research. The content of the report mainly is about the process and evaluations when carrying out the calculation process.
